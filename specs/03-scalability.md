# Scalability Specification

## Overview

This specification outlines the requirements for ensuring the app can scale to accommodate a growing number of users and data.

## Objectives

- Support a large number of concurrent users.
- Efficiently handle large datasets.
- Ensure performance remains optimal as the app scales.

## Features

- **Load Balancing**: Implement load balancing to distribute traffic evenly.
- **Database Optimization**: Use indexing and query optimization for efficient data retrieval.
- **Caching**: Implement caching strategies to reduce load times.

## Technical Requirements

- Use cloud services like AWS or Azure for scalable infrastructure.
- Implement database indexing and query optimization.
- Use Redis or similar for caching.

## Testing

- Conduct load testing to simulate high traffic scenarios.
- Monitor performance metrics to identify bottlenecks.
- Test database performance with large datasets.
